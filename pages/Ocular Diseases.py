Ocular diseases â€” a broad term for conditions that affect parts of the eye like the cornea, lens, retina, and optic nerve â€” affect roughly **2.2 billion people** around the world. Furthermore, almost **two-thirds of adults** report experiencing vision issues, yet only **one in eight** report seeking care.

Although improvements in imaging technology have made it easier to diagnose problems, many people either donâ€™t have access to regular eye care or simply donâ€™t prioritize it. This has caused conditions like **glaucoma**, **cataracts**, and **diabetic retinopathy** to often go unnoticed until theyâ€™ve already caused **permanent vision loss**.

As the issue of ocular diseases steadily rises, ophthalmologists are pushing for ways to make diagnosis for these issues as **efficient** and **cheap** as possible.
